A simple web application that computes the longest common subsequence between two strings and displays the longest common subsequence between them.

**Features**
- Custom Sequence Input: Input any sequence of characters in both input fields and the longest common subsequence length with be displayed and the common characters highlighted.
- Random Sequence Input: Specify the lengths and degree of variance between the two sequences. Only uppercase English letters are used to generate sequences. Valid degrees of variance are 1-26, the number of distinct letters in the English alphabet; and length is restricted to 20.
